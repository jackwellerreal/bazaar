# Bazaar

## About

This is a simulator for the Bazaar from Hypixel Skyblock. The point of this is to allow players to practice bazaar flipping without using in-game coins. It is not affiliated with Hypixel in any way and any trades made here will not affect your Hypixel Skyblock profile.

## How to use

To start flipping, click on the button in the nagivation bar. You can use the replica of the in game GUI to buy and sell items. The price data is fetched from the Hypixel Bazaar API, so it should be accurate to the current bazaar prices.

## Tips

- **Buy low, sell high:** The key to flipping is to buy items at a low price and sell them at a higher price.
- **Check the price history:** Use websites like [skyblock.bz](https://skyblock.bz) to check the price history of items. If the average price is normally higher than the current price, it might be a good time to buy.
- **Be patient:** Don't spend all your coins on a one trade, even if it looks like a good deal. Doing so will leave you with nothing if it goes wrong.
- **Buy strategically:** Most of the time when flipping, your orders will not fill instantly. Be patient and wait for the orders to fill. If you are impatient, you might end up selling at a loss.
